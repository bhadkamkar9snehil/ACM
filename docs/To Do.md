# To Do (Deprecated)

The consolidated task list now lives in **Task Backlog.md** and, moving forward, all actionable work is tracked as GitHub Issues. This file remains only as a pointer for older documentation.

- **Current source of truth:** `Task Backlog.md` (root) + GitHub Issues board
- **Legacy backups:** `Task Backlog.md` Git history and the `ACM_V6_BACKUP` folder

If you follow a link in older documents that mentions `# To Do.md`, update it to reference the Task Backlog or, preferably, the relevant GitHub issue.
