 EMPTY PANELS (Tables missing or empty):
━

1. Days Since Alert Stat
   Query: SELECT TOP 1 DATEDIFF(day, StartTimestamp, GETDATE()) as DaysSince
          FROM ACM_AlertAge 
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: Populate ACM_AlertAge or change to use ACM_HealthTimeline

2. Active Episodes Stat
   Query: SELECT COUNT(*) as ActiveEpisodes
          FROM ACM_CulpritHistory 
          WHERE EndTimestamp IS NULL OR EndTimestamp >= DATEADD(hour, -24, GETDATE())
   Status:  Table EXISTS but query uses GETDATE() with historical data
   Fix: Change GETDATE() to () or use relative time

3. Defect Timeline Chart
   Query: SELECT Timestamp, HealthIndex, FusedZ
          FROM ACM_DefectTimeline
   Status:  Table EXISTS and has data (FD_FAN: 24 rows, GAS_TURBINE: 4 rows)
   Fix: None needed - should work

4. Health Zone Distribution
   Query: SELECT PeriodStart, HealthZone, ZonePct
          FROM ACM_HealthZoneByPeriod
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: This is a rollup table - needs population

5. Drift Timeline Chart
   Query: SELECT Timestamp, DriftValue
          FROM ACM_DriftSeries
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: Check ACM_Drift_TS instead (new table we created)

6. Detector Contribution Current
   Query: SELECT DetectorType, ContributionPct, ZScore
          FROM ACM_ContributionCurrent
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: This is a current state table - needs population

7. Detector Contribution Timeline
   Query: SELECT Timestamp, DetectorType, ContributionPct
          FROM ACM_ContributionTimeline
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: This is a time series table - needs population

8. Detector Correlation Heatmap
   Query: SELECT DetectorA, DetectorB, PearsonR
          FROM ACM_DetectorCorrelation
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: Check if correlations are being calculated

9. Sensor Anomaly by Period
   Query: SELECT PeriodStart, DetectorType, AnomalyRatePct
          FROM ACM_SensorAnomalyByPeriod
   Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
   Fix: This is a rollup table - needs population

10. Calibration Summary Table
    Query: SELECT DetectorType, MeanZ, P95Z, P99Z, ClipZ, SaturationPct
           FROM ACM_CalibrationSummary
    Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
    Fix: Check if calibration metrics are being written

11. Regime Stability Metrics
    Query: SELECT MetricName, MetricValue
           FROM ACM_RegimeStability
    Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
    Fix: Check if regime stability metrics are being calculated

12. Sensor Forecast Chart
    Query: SELECT Timestamp, SensorName, ForecastValue
           FROM ACM_SensorForecast_TS
    Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
    Fix: Check if sensor-level forecasts are enabled

13. Maintenance Recommendation Table
    Query: SELECT EarliestMaintenance, PreferredWindowStart, PreferredWindowEnd
           FROM ACM_MaintenanceRecommendation
    Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
    Fix: Check if maintenance recommendations are being generated

14. Normalized Sensor Values Chart
    Query: SELECT Timestamp, SensorName, NormValue
           FROM ACM_SensorNormalized_TS
    Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
    Fix: Check if normalized values are being written

15. Sensor Z-Scores Chart
    Query: SELECT Timestamp, SensorName, ZScore
           FROM ACM_SensorNormalized_TS
    Status:  Table EXISTS but likely EMPTY
    Fix: Check if sensor z-scores are being written

SUMMARY:

Total Panels: ~28
Working Panels: 13 (46%)
Empty Panels: 15 (54%)

QUICK WIN FIXES:

1. Change ACM_DriftSeries  ACM_Drift_TS (table was renamed)
2. Fix GETDATE() time references  use Grafana time macros
3. Verify output_manager is writing to all expected tables
